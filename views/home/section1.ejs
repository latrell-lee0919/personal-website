            <p>I am currently an Associate Software Engineer at Capital One Financial.
                I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2020 with my degree in Commerce,
                concentrating in Information Technology. Upon graduating, I joined Capital One under
                their CODA (Capital One Developer Academy) program in order to focus on learning full stack
                web-development skills.
